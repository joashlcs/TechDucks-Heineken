# Techducks x Heineken F1 2023

### Theme: Digital Inclusion

#### This marketing campaign has been developed to encourage f1-goers to enjoy their beer in a responsible way! By getting to know their limit through our fun & interactive reaction test, they wil begin to be more conscious of their drinking limits. As a result, they will become much safer when drinking!

Check out our live version & give it a try [here](https://testdriven.io/developing-a-single-page-app-with-flask-and-vuejs)!
